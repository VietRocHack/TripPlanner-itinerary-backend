NOTES

Remember that you should include an activity for lunch if times include between 11:00 and 14:00, and dinner if times include between 18:00 and 20:00. These activities should only include the words "Lunch" and "Dinner" in the "activity" field.

When creating a travel plan, remember to take travel times, average time spending at each destination and open hours of each attraction into account. Prefer routes where you have to travel as less as possible.
